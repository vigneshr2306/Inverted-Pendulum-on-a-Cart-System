# Inverted-Pendulum-on-a-Cart-System
Read my thesis on Study and Control of Dynamics of Inverted Pendulum System to understand the problem statement and details of my hardware setup. Check out my paper here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40435-020-00753-5

## State-space feedback approach:
1. To reproduce the state-space feedback approach, the inv_pendulum.ino file should be used.
2. This can be done using the Arduino IDE, and select libraries for STM32F103C8T6 installed in the system.
3. Motor pins, encoder pins should be connected correspondingly to the STM32.
4. After running the code, the state variables can be monitored using the Serial Monitor.

## Reinforcement Learning approach:
To execute this approach, ```python3 cartpole.py```
